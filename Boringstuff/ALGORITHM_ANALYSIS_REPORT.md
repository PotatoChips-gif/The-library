## 1. Data Structures Implementation

### 1.1 Queue ADT (First In First Out - FIFO)

**Implementation Location**: `server/utils/dataStructures/Queue.js`

**Purpose**: Order processing pipeline where orders are processed in the sequence they arrive.

**Operations Implemented**:
- `enqueue(element)` - Add element to rear
- `dequeue()` - Remove element from front  
- `peek()` - View front element without removal
- `isEmpty()` - Check if queue is empty
- `size()` - Get number of elements
- `clear()` - Remove all elements

**Time Complexity Analysis**:
- Enqueue: O(1) - Constant time insertion at rear
- Dequeue: O(1) - Constant time removal from front
- Peek: O(1) - Direct access to front element
- Size: O(1) - Maintained counter
- isEmpty: O(1) - Simple comparison

**Space Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of elements

**Trade-offs**:
- **Benefits**: Fast insertion and removal, maintains order, simple implementation
- **Drawbacks**: No random access, memory usage grows with queue size
- **Use Case**: Perfect for order processing where FIFO behavior is required

### 1.2 Stack ADT (Last In First Out - LIFO)

**Implementation Location**: `server/utils/dataStructures/Stack.js`

**Purpose**: Processing history and undo operations for order management.

**Operations Implemented**:
- `push(element)` - Add element to top
- `pop()` - Remove element from top
- `peek()` - View top element without removal
- `isEmpty()` - Check if stack is empty
- `size()` - Get number of elements
- `contains(element)` - Search for element

**Time Complexity Analysis**:
- Push: O(1) - Constant time insertion at top
- Pop: O(1) - Constant time removal from top
- Peek: O(1) - Direct access to top element
- Contains: O(n) - Linear search through stack

**Space Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of elements

**Trade-offs**:
- **Benefits**: Fast insertion/removal, natural for undo operations, simple implementation
- **Drawbacks**: No random access, LIFO order may not suit all use cases
- **Use Case**: Ideal for operation history and undo functionality

**Time Complexity**:
- Best Case: O(n log n) - Balanced partitions
- Average Case: O(n log n) - Random pivots
- Worst Case: O(n²) - Poor pivot selection

**Space Complexity**: O(log n) - Recursive call stack

**Stability**: Not stable - Partitioning may change order

**Best Use Cases**:
- Large datasets
- General-purpose sorting
- When average-case performance is important

### 2.4 Merge Sort

**Algorithm Description**: Divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides array and merges sorted halves.

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n) for all cases - Consistent performance

**Space Complexity**: O(n) - Additional array for merging

**Stability**: Stable - Maintains relative order during merging

**Best Use Cases**:
- Large datasets
- When stability is required
- When consistent performance is needed
- External sorting (large files)

### 2.5 Performance Comparison
